            <p> According to Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), though there are many trends that has be considered for the study. It’s important to note the following.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There are four key paths leading to your estate: Credentials, Phishing, Exploiting vulnerabilities and Botnets. These four pervade all areas of the DBIR, and no organization is safe without a plan to handle them all. The priority
                being to protect the Credential information.</li>
              <li>This year, Ransomware has continued its upward trend with an almost 13% increase–a rise as big as the last five years combined (for a total of 25% this year). It’s important to remember, Ransomware by itself is just a model
                of monetizing an organization’s access. Blocking the four key paths mentioned above helps to block the most common routes Ransomware uses to invade your network.</li>
              <li>Error continues to be a dominant trend and is responsible for 13% of breaches. This finding is heavily influenced by misconfigured cloud storage. While this is the second year in a row that we have seen a slight levelling out
                for this pattern, the fallibility of employees should not be discounted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on the IBM's Cost of a Data Breach report, the global average total cost of a data breach increased by USD 0.11 million to USD 4.35 million in 2022, the highest it’s been in the history of this report. The increase from USD
              4.24 million in the 2021 report to USD 4.35 million in the 2022 report represents a 2.6% increase. In the last two years, the average total cost has increased 12.7% from USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report.</p>
